# RISC-V Linux Vector Example

This is a simple dot product calculation program to demonstrate Linux's userspace RVV capabilities.

Requires a toolchain with kernel headers from [here](https://github.com/sifive/riscv-linux/tree/riscv/for-next/vector-v20), since upstream Linux does not support RVV yet (as of June 2023).
